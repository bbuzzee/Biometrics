Introductory Information:

This data was collected as part of a mark-recapture study on the Threemile lake complex in Beluga, AK. 
The goal was to estimate the number of northern pike >= 300mm present to serve as a reference after future suppression efforts. 


Filenames: 

"mark_data_raw" is the raw data from the mark event. The first 7 columns represent all the data from the "mark" event.
"recap_dissection_raw" is the raw data from the recap event, all fish caught during the recap event were brought to shore and measured/dissected
"mark_data_raw" and "recap_dissection_raw" were combined into "clean_mr_data" to use in the abundance estimate.
Duplicate copies in .csv format were created so the files could be easily read into R

Methodological Information:

The lake was divided into roughly equally sized sections. Each section was fished with gillnets and hook & line.
The same number of gillnets and same soaktimes were used in each section, and the nets were spread out uniformly. Four anglers
fished each section (two from shore, two from boat) and systematically worked their way around the permiter of each section. Each section 
was fished for a total of two days during both the mark and recapture events.
