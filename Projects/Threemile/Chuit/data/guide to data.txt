From Parker:

"Dissection data which has 4 tabs (Chuit Mark, Threemile, Chuit Recap, then Chuit mark/recap combined).  
Next is the catch data from Chuit (separate tables for event type and gear type).
Finally, the catch data from Threemile (Two tabs for gear type). 

As you can imagine, the totals don’t completely jive between the catch data and the dissection data.  It appears anglers kids didn’t do so well filling out catch forms, 
so the dissectors have a couple more fish than the “catch” that some days for both Threemile and Chuit.  Also, there was a couple days where a couple extra fish were caught in nets and not dissected, 
or a couple more dissected than caught in nets in Threemile, but it’s just a few, and overall totals match up, so forget I said anything with that.  Chuit gillnet catch data and dissections match up good.

I’ve included a few notes at the top in some of the sheets, should be pretty self explanatory.

Ben, for the Chuit Pop estimate, I would use the data in the file “2019 Chuit catch data” under the tabs “Gillnets Mark Chuit” and “Angling Mark Chuit” for mark data.
For recap data, I would use the file “2019 Dissection Data”, then use tab “Chuit Recap”.  However, I did do quite a bit of comparison between the dissection data and the catch data during the recap event,
and noticed that there was a tag loss noted in the Chuit recap event that was not noted in the dissections that day, but I’ve made a note of that in one of the tabs."


=================================

I saved the sheets Parker mentioned in the last paragraph above ('gillnet mark chuit', 'angling mark chut', and 'chuit recap') as csv files so they can be easily read into R.
